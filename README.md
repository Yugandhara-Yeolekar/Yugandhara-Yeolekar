# Hey, I'm 𝙔𝙪𝙜𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙖 👋🏻
*Turning data into visual understanding*

### About Me  
**📊 Data Analyst | Visualization Geek**  

I transform abstract data into interactive insight—because true understanding begins when patterns become visible.  

**Tools I trust:**  
- Python for precision visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Streamlit`)  
- Tableau/Power BI for rapid, stakeholder-ready analytics  

**Tools I respect:**  
- SQL for structured interrogation  
- Excel for tactical data manipulation  

**Core principle:** Visualization isn't decorative—it's the critical bridge between data and decision-making.

### 🌿 Beyond the Numbers  
When I'm not wrangling data:  
• You'll find me knee-deep in **climate datasets** - mapping the disconnect between what we take and what we need  
• On a **roadtrip through quiet towns** - my reset button for that eagles-eye view of what matters  
• **Becoming** - closing the gap between my values and my velocity
